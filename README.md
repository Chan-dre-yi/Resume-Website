# my-CV
Here's the code to my RESUME WEBSITE which I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We were taught various web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Servelets, Node.js and MongoDB in our eighth semester which helped me come up with this, along with some help from the internet ofcourse!
